Hi, I’m Nadia.
I’m passionate about mathematics. Since Machine Learning is an up and coming field that uses mathematical concepts and has potential for growth and research,
I am naturally gravitated towards this field. 
Currently I am a student at Geoergia Tech, having fun learning application of statistics, Linear Algebra and differential geometry in Data Science. 
Recently I have gotten interested in NLP and image processing. There is a lot of potential with respect to coming up with new mathematical models in both these areas of machine learning.
I am looking to collabrate on projects related to summarizing text and image recocignition.
I can be contacted at nadiapasha30@gmail.com
