Hi, I’m Nadia.
I’m passionate about mathematics. Since Data Science is an up and coming field that uses mathematical concepts and has potential for growth and research,
I am naturally gravitated towards this field. 
Currently I am a student at Geoergia Tech, having fun learning application of statistics and Linear Algebra in Data Science. 
Recently I have gotten interested in NLP. There is a lot of potential with respect to coming up with new mathematical models to help with natural language 
procesing.
I am looking to collabrate on projects related to sentiment analysis and summarizing text.
