Hi, I’m Nadia. I’m passionate about mathematics and its applications in Machine Learning. I just got done with my masters in Analytics with a focus in Deep Learning from Groegia Tech. I understand the underlying theory in machine learning algorithms which helps in troubleshooting and tweaking models to address unique scenarios that every problem presents. In addition to the knowledge gained from academics, I have experience working on SOTA Deep Learning models for a small R&D team. Currently I am working on a Machine Translation project for a low resource language (URDU).
